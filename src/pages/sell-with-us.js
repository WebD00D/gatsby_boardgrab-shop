     for sale across the country. After getting burned on Craigslist one too many times, 
     we decided to make something easier, friendlier and way more extensive.
      It’s a big idea but a really simple one. Every used board in surf shops from coast to coast. 
      Everything is easily searchable, with honest, clear descriptions and hi-res photos. 
      If you have a question or want a measurement or more photos, we’re always available.</p>
